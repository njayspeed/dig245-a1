    <h3>Reasons/Goals</h3>
    <p>I am taking this course because I am interested in
      Front End web development. I don't have much design
      experience myself nor do I think i am a good designer or artist
      but I'd like to work on my design skills. When I look at site like
      Apple or Tinder I am amazed about how they are designed. I want to
    try and build website like that. </p>
    <div>
      <p>Goals</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (also possibly React)</li>
        <li>Create a website</li>
        <li>Be able to use these skills in everyday life/ for a job</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

  <div id="experience">
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I have no experience with Front End development or creating
    code for the web. However, I do have a ton of experience with coding
    Back End development. I have been studying Computer Science for 3 years now.
    I am experienced in Python, Java, and C, and I have work experience in the
    AI/ Machine Learning field.</p>

    <h3>Projects I Like</h3>
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I like the Apple site's design because its easy to use. Also,
      like all Apple sites, the design looks innovative and beautiful.
      They also present their products well.</li>
    </ul>

    <a href="https://tinder.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Tinder</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I like Tinder because the flow of the website is easy and simple.
      Anyone can sign up quick and easy with a phone number and/or facebook account.
      Once you're in, all you have to do is upload picture and swipe left or right!
      They also engage users with the different activities they do.</li>
    </ul>

    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The facebook site may seem intimidating at first glance because there is
      alot going on. However, you'll soon find out that the site is easy to use and
      that it literally has everything you need. You can chat with friends, buy or
    sell items, or even just scrool through news/posts.</li>
    </ul>
