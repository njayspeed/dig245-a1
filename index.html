    <h3>Reasons/Goals</h3>
    <p>I am taking this course because I am interested in
      Front End web development. I don't have much design
      experience myself nor do I think i am a good designer or artist
      but I'd like to work on my design skills. When I look at site like
      Apple or Tinder I am amazed about how they are designed. I want to
    try and build website like that. </p>
    <div>
      <p>Goals</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (also possibly React)</li>
        <li>Create a website</li>
        <li>Be able to use these skills in everyday life/ for a job</li>
      </ol>
